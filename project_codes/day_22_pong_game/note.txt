The program works fine, but there is a problem with the actual screensize for the game and how the codes that uses it interacts.
It uses the turtle lirbary, the screen is set to be 800 by width and 600 by height.
But when I code the game I got an offset of 100 and -100 in the x coordinates. The same goes with the y coordinates.
Currently using gnu/linux from Ubuntu. Previously my distro was Fedora and I didn't encounter the same issues. 
Overall, the game works fine. Just there are offsets in the coordinates. To whom ever can offer any help. Thanks in advance.
Currently I'm looking for solutions about it.
